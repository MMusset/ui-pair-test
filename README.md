A company (PayBetter ltd) offers a service called Crosspay, that allows cross countries payments.
A commission fee will be applied on each payment, based on the payer's currency.

At the moment the Crosspay service is available for 3 currencies.
Below are the currencies the service can be used with, and the correspondent commission fee:
- USD: 0.5%
- GBP: 0.25%
- EUR: 0.75%

You're requested to implement a basic html/javascript page(vue, react, jQuery etc.) that takes an array of payments (see ./input.rb) and
and returns an array of payments containing the commission fee for each payment (see ./output.rb).

Then displays each payment and its commission fee on a website page in a browser.
